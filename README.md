## Classic Snake Style of Game 
Purely for learning and solidifying python3 through a fun way. After learning the basics of python3 with the pong tutorial I followed in this repo [here](https://github.com/jcamarao/Python_Pong), I am now currently making snake without a tutorial to see if I can challenge myself to make something different with the basic tools provided.

## Snake game set up using the base turtle module built into python
- Set up is similar to Pong, in the aspect that I am focusing around MacOS 
  - All that needs to be modified for windows/unix is the sound setup
